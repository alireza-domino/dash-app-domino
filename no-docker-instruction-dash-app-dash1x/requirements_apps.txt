# Some Python examples in this project require additional packages. These packages are being installed
# via this requirements file as a convenience for environments that don't have them pre-installed. 
#
#Files named requirements.txt will automatically be installed at the begining of any workspace, job or App. 
#This file is manually loaded in the Flask and Dash Apps in this project as those are the only files requiring these packages. 
#
# This method of installing Python packages is convenient, but for faster launches, it is recommended
# to add packages to the Compute Environment instead of using a requirements.txt file.
